## introduction

Hi everyone my name is Nimo Hersi I live in the greater Seattle area My professional experience was in medical assistance phlebotomy I went to Seattle Central Community College and did my first two years of college. I am here to change my career to software development. Iâ€™m a beginner and I do not have experience in coding but I will do my best to make it.

# growth mindset

* As a coding newcomer I know that coding takes time to master, and I'll stay patient with myself. I will welcome the challenges and mistakes as opportunities for growth. I will measure progress by my own journey, stay curious, and believe in my potential to become a skilled coder. I'm excited about the challenges and discoveries that lie ahead.

 # Three Reminders of self-growth mindset

1. Set challenging goals
   
     * Challenges are my favorite part. They push me to expand my knowledge and skills, and I actively seek out projects and problems that stretch my abilities. 
  
2. To be patient
 
     * Patience is my virtue. Coding can be tough, but I know that consistent effort leads to progress. 

 3. Learn from failure
  
     * Making mistakes is not something to be afraid of any error in my code is a lesson waiting to be learned, and I eagerly welcome them as part of my coding education.
