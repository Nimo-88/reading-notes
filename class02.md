A command terminal is a text-based interface for controlling a computer by typing commands.

feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed.

+ Pwd print working directory it takes you into the folder 
+ Ls: ls gives your list of current 
+ Cd: Change directory, it will take you to your home directory
+ Mk dir: is to create a new folder
+ touch: means to Create a new file


### Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

1. cd projects: command changes your current directory to "projects."
2. mkdir new-project: Creating a directory using mkdir new-project will make a new folder called "new-project" in your current directory. 
3. touch new-project/new-file.md: creates an empty file named "new-file.md" inside the "new-project" directory for storing.
4. cd..it takes you back two steps.
5. ls projects/new-project: It will display the files and subdirectories within the new-project.
